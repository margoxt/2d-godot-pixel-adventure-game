 🏰 Knight's Quest — A Simple Adventure. 
 Knight's Quest is a fun and simple 2D platformer game built with Godot. You play as a brave little knight who jumps across platforms, collects coins, and avoids dangerous slimes. Inspired by classic platformers like Mario, this game focuses on smooth jumping mechanics and basic enemy avoidance in a charming pixel world.

## Purpose
The main goal of this project was to:
- Familiarize myself with the Godot editor and workflow
- Practice basic scene and node setups
- Experiment with 2D game mechanics such as movement, collisions, and signals
- Understand basic GDScript syntax and logic

## 🔧 Features
- Simple 2D scene with basic player controls
- Use of nodes like `KinematicBody2D`, `Sprite`, and `CollisionShape2D`
- Basic physics interactions and input handling
- Minimal UI elements

## 📌 Notes
- This project is **not** intended for release or production use.
